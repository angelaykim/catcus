Partial Plan for Catman: (Team plan stays unchanged)

Changes to original plan:
  - grid is gone 
  - turned into a world of free dots and one/two ghosts randomly moving
  - catman needs to eat all the dots to win
  - dies if hit by a ghost 
  

----> ----> ----> -----> sequency
   - size 
   - dots setup 
   - pacman setup (shape, moving, size, boundary reaction)
   - confrontation! between pac and dot --> earning/losing pts
   - [entire game functioning so far?]
   
   - ghost [appeaerance, moving constantly]
   - ghost pac confrontation!
   
   - background, shape of everything 
   - music?

[20170604] finish this catman!
