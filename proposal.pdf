Atari Breakout and Space Invaders

Overview
	We plan on creating an arcade-like setting, with several different games. We will be remaking older games, Atari Breakout and Space Invaders. We will have a menu with different buttons that will then start the chosen button’s respective game. In Atari Breakout, we will use  Queue for the balls, have a superclass for different kinds of blocks at different levels, and state variables for the states of the blocks. 
Similarly, Space Invaders will also have a Queue for the spaceships, and a superclass for the different aliens. Overall, both games will have a way to keep track of lives, highscores, and usernames.

Java Concepts to be Implemented
Structure
Queue: balls in Atari, shooters in Invaders
Also to keep track of lives left
Superclasses for blocks and aliens
Which gives all blocks or all aliens the same basic structure but allows for further implementation of specific properties, such as size, color, etc. 
Object creation and instance variables 
Creates the player and attach to it its properties that need to be kept track of, such as lives, highscore, username, state (which changes after hitting different blocks) etc.
Same thing for blocks and aliens.
Sort for highscore (username tags)

Additional Designs
Import images for backgrounds 
Design player, blocks, and aliens using shapes (they could be cats, food, and anything that’s cute :)
Import sound files to provide sound effects for shooting targets and/or losing lives (if allowed).
Text description of each game on the main menu page and brief explanation of points gaining and losing rules. (i.e. Shooting a small alien → 1 point; Shooting a big alien → 3 points, etc.)
